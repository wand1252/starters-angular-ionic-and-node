# Contributing

To get started, clone the repo, run `npm i`, and then `npm run tsc` (or `npm run
tsc -- -w`). We use TypeScript, so code must be compiled before it runs.

## Generating

You can generate the starters by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

Starters are generated by overlaying starter files (located in
`<type>/starters/<name>`) onto base files (located in `<type>/base/`) into the
`build/` directory.

Then, the starter manifest file is read (located at
`<type>/starters/<name>/ionic.starter.json`), invoking additional operations on
the generated starter files.

### Manifest Operations

The starter manifest file is a JSON file. The build process reads the manifest
and takes actions based upon what's defined in the file.

`dependencies`: Merge the defined dependencies into `package.json`, overwriting
any existing keys.

## Deploying

During the deploy process, the `build/` directory is read and an archive of each
generated starter is created and gzipped and uploaded to an S3 bucket. The S3
bucket has a CloudFront distribution for close-proximity downloads. The
distribution ID is `E1XZ2T0DZXJ521` and can be found [at this
URL](https://d2ql0qc7j8u4b2.cloudfront.net).

Starters are deployed automatically when new commits are pushed to the `master`
branch. To deploy manually, run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
